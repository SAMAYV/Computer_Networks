Q1

a) The option required to specify the number of echo requests to send with ping command is '-c'.
b) The time interval between two successive ping requests can be set using '-i' option (time in seconds).
c) We can send packets to the destination one after another without waiting for a reply by using the '-l' option. Normal users can only send 3 packets using this option. Also, the destination can be flooded with ping requests without by using '-f' option. Also time interval can be set 0 seconds using '-i'. 
d) The packet size can be set with the '-s' option (size in bytes). The actual packet size will be slightly larger than what we give due to the addition of the ICMP header(8 Bytes) and IP Headers(20 Bytes). Hence, total packet size will be 60 bytes if size is set as 32 bytes.

RTT V/S DISTANCE : We can conclude that there exists a positive correlation between the Geographic distance and Round Trip Time (RTT). They are correlated because of reasons like increased number of hops and increased propagation delay. Larger the distance, longer it takes for a packets to propogate (Propagation delay). Also, the packets have to go through more number of nodes and there may be a delay at nodes. Hence, more the routers, longer is the RTT. It is a weak relation because there are many other factors on which it depends like network traffic and the server capacities.

PACKET LOSS : No cases of packet loss greater than 0% was found. But in general, packet loss can be greater than 0% because of network congestion and traffic. Some packets may collide with other packets in the network and result in packet loss. Sometimes, there may be 100% packet loss. In such cases, generally the destination server drops all the ping ICMP packets.

V/S DAY OF TIME: We observed that RTT’s vary with time of the day. At different times, the congestion in network is different. From the observations, we can say that RTT is least at 1:00 am and maximum at 7:00pm. Around 1:00pm, RTT is little less than that at 7:00pm. Hence, we can conclude that the network traffic is high around 7:00pm.

RTT V/S PACKET SIZE : We can clearly observe that the Round Trip Time(RTT) is almost the same for packets upto size 1280 Bytes. After that, we
observe a sudden jump in the RTT. This is beacuse the Maximum Transmission Unit(MTU) is 1500 Bytes by default. If the packet size is less than 1500 Bytes, then the data is padded to make the size 1500 Bytes. Hence for packets with size less than 1500 Bytes, the RTT is same. If packet size is more than
1500 Bytes, then the packet is broken into two frames of size 1500 Bytes. Hence we observe an almost twice the RTT for packets of size 1536 bytes to 2048 bytes.

Q3

On plotting the curves as histograms, we observe that they resemble the shape of Normal Distritbution. The two cases are very similar to each other except in two aspects. 

Firstly, no attempt will be made to lookup symbolic names for host addresses when using '-n', hence it will be faster. So, the mean Latency is higher in second case than the mean latency in the first case. Secondly '-p ff00' will cause the sent packet to be filled with the pattern 11111100000000 which is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a network. This will cause problems with the synchronisation of the clocks because only one transition is present in the padding, from 1 to 0. Hence, the clocks are more likely to go out of synchronisation in second case and we observe that the packet loss is higher in the second case.

Q4

a) 

The interfaces are wireless ethernet(enp0s31f6),a loopback interface(lo) and wired ethernet(virbr0) in my case. 

inet addr: IPv4 address assigned to the interface. 
inet6 addr: IPv6 address assigned to the interface.
netmask: Network mask that shows how much of the address is routable, which determines whether the computer can connect directly to a device on the LAN or whether it needs to send the packet to a router. 
broadcast: Denotes the broadcast address (The address required to broadcast on the network connected through that interface of the machine).
RUNNING : Indicates that the network interface is operational and is ready to accept the data. 
MULTICAST : Denotes that the Ethernet device supports multicasting. 
MTU: The maximum transmission unit for which the interface is configured. It provides limit on the size of the packet received by the Ethernet card. 1500 is the default value of size of the packet for all ethernet devices. 
RX packets: Total number of received packets. 
	1) Errors: Number of damaged packets received.
	2) Dropped: Number of dropped packets due to reception errors.
	3) Overruns: Number of received packets that experienced data overruns.
	4) Frame: Number of received packets that experienced frame errors.
TX packets : Total number of transmitted packets. 
	1) Errors: Number of packets that experienced transmission error.
	2) Dropped: Number of dropped transmitted packets due to transmission errors.
	3) Overruns: Number of transmitted packets that experienced data overruns.
	4) Carrier: Number received packets that experienced loss of carriers. 
	5) Collisions: Number of packets that are colliding while traversing the network due to network congestion. 

txqueuelen : Length of the transmit queue of the NIC. 
RX bytes, TX bytes : Indicates the total amount of data that has passed through the interface either way. 

b) Some options for ifconfig includes 
 1) -a to display information for all network interfaces, both active and inactive. 
 2) -v for verbose mode, to display additional information for each network interface.   
 3) -s : This is the "short listing" option, which shows a one-line summarized listing of data about each interface.
 4) up - This flag causes the interface to be activated. 
 5) down - This flag causes the deactivation of the specified interface.  
 6) metric N - Sets the interface metric, which is used by the interface to make routing decision. 
 7) add address to add an IPv6 address to an interface.  
 8) del address to remove an IPv6 address from an interface.

The route command is used to manipulate the kernel’s routing tables. Its primary use is to setup static routes to specific hosts or networks. 
The Destination column identifies the destination network or destination host. The Gateway column identifies the
defined gateway for the specified network. An asterisk (*) appears in this column if no forwarding gateway is needed for the
network. The Genmask column shows the netmask for the network. The Iface column shows the network interface. 'eno1' is for
the Ethernet device and 'wlo1' is for the Wireless Ethernet device. Under the Flags section, the U flag means the route is up, and
the G flag means that specified gateway should be used for this route. Metric is the distance to the target (usually counted in
hops). Ref is the number of references to this route. 

Route command has many options 
1) '-n' is used to display the numerical IP address.
2) '-C' is used to list the kernel’s routing cache information. 
3) '-v' to select verbose operation, '-net' specifies that the target is a network and '-host' specifies that the target is a host.
4) 'del' to delete a route and 'add' to add a route.

Q5

a) 	Netstat (network statistics) is a command line tool for monitoring network connections both incoming and outgoing as well as viewing routing tables, interface statistics etc. It displays active TCP connections, ports on which the computer is listening, Ethernet statistics, IP routing table, IPv4 statistics and IPv6 statistics. It is one of the most basic network service debugging tools.

b) -at option is used to list all TPC connections and pipe operator with grep command is used to filter all established connections. Command: netstat -at | grep "ESTABLISHED". 

c) The -r option of netstat displays the IP routing table.
	The Destination column indicates the destination of a packet. When a packet has to be sent over th network, this table is examined top to bottom, and the first line with a matching destination is then used to determine where to send the packet. 
	The Gateway column tells the computer where to send a packet that matches the destination. An asterisk (*) here means send locally. 
	The Genmask column tells how many bits from the start of the ip address are used to identify the subnet. It is 255 for non-zero part and 0 for other parts of the destination. 
	The Flags column displays the flags that describe the route - G(route uses a gateway), U(interface is up), H(Only a single host can be reached through the route), D(route is dynamically created), M(route is set if the table entry was modified by an ICMP redirect message), !(route is a reject route and datagrams will be dropped). 
	The MSS(Maximum Segment Size) is the size of the largest datagram the kernel will construct for transmission via this route. 
	The Window is the maximum amount of data the system will accept in a single burst from a remote host. 
	The irtt is the initial round trip time. 
	The Iface column tells which network interface should be used for sending packets that match the destination.

d) '-i' option of netstat can be used to display the status of all network interfaces.
	My machine has 5 interfaces, which are docker0, enp2s0, lo, virbr0, wlp1s0. The MTU and Met fields show the current MTU and metric values for that interface.
	The RX and TX columns show how many packets have been received or transmitted error-free(RX-OK/TX-OK), damaged(RX- ERR/TX-ERR), dropped(RX-DRP/TX-DRP) and lost because of an overrun (RX-OVR/TX-OVR). The last column shows the flags that have been set for this interface.

e) '-a -u -s' option of netstat can be used to show the statistics of all UDP connections. 

f) 
	The loopback device is a special, virtual network interface that the computer uses to communicate with itself. It is used mainly for diagnostics and 	troubleshooting, and to connect to servers running on the local machine. When a network interface is disconnected, no communication on that interface is possible, not even communication between the computer and itself. The loopback interface does not represent any actual hardware, but exists so applications running on the computer can always connect to servers on the same machine. For example, if you run a web server, you have all your web documents and could examine them file by file on the local machine. For IPv4, the loopback interface is assigned all the IPs in the 127.0.0.0/8 address block (i.e.127.0.0.1 through 127.255.255.254).

Q6



a) Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to track in real-time the pathway taken by a packet on an IP network from source to destination, reporting the IP addresses of all the routers it pinged in between, allowing administrators to better resolve connectivity issues.. Traceroute also records the time taken for each hop the packet makes during its route to the destination.

b) Hops are common because of the reason that routes to these destinations pass through the same internet circles and hence overlap.

c) The route to the hosts changes at different times of the day because of network congestion. The packets are redirected to take a route having less traffic. The load balancing is done to reduce the load of the path taken.

d) Sometimes, traceroute might not find a complete path to some host. Some servers/hosts along the path may have not been configured to respond to the Traffic or have set up firewalls which blocks the ICMP Traffic. Hence the data is send to the next hop without determining any network communication issues. Many network providers disable ICMP traffic if their network is under heavy load.

e) It is possible to find the route to certain hosts which fail to respond with ping experiment. The ping and traceroute both use the ICMP Packets but their working is different. Ping is straight ICMP, that uses routing rules and expects a ICMP Reply from the host. Most probably the server is blocking the reply. 
Traceroute sends packets with TTL values that increases from packet to packet. Routers decrement TTL values and discard packets whose TTL value has reached zero, returning the ICMP error. Traceroute looks for the ICMP Time exceeded packet and that is why it might be possible.

Q7

a) ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. $arp –a shows the complete ARP Table of the machine. It shows the IP-Address, the corresponding MAC Address and the Network Interface.

b) An entry for the IP address can be deleted from the ARP table using the command "$ arp –d <address>". If you want to make a specific MAC address be used for an IP,use the command: "$ arp -s <ip_addr> <MAC_addr>". You need to run it as a root user. 

(c) ARP only works between devices in the same IP subnet.

When device A needs to send a packet to device B, it will first check its routing table to determine if IP address of B belongs to a subnet which can be reached through its network interfaces.
If it happens, then device A uses ARP to map IP address of B to a physical Ethernet address and then sends an Ethernet packets to that address.

But if the two IP Addresses are on different subnets: it will look for a route to the destination network and then it will send its packet to the appropriate router (or to its default gateway if no more specific route is present). ARP will be used to find the hardware address of the router as the packet must be delivered to a router which can take care of it.

(d) 100% packet loss after pinging the IP with replaced address.

Q8

a) nmap –n –sP <IP Address>/<Subnet Range>
b)
